This repository is a collection of useful Premake scripts and smaller extensions that don't merit repositories of their own. It's intended to be used as a submodule in other Premake-based projects.

### Contents

ðŸ“¦ **conan.lua**

A script that simplifies integration of [Conan](https://conan.io/) packages in Premake-based C++ projects.

Once included, it automatically downloads a Conan standalone and provides the user with the helper function `conan.require(...)` which installs a package and links it to the current project.
